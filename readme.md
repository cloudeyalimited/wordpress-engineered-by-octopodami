# WordPress Engineered by OCTOPODAMI (WEBO)

With WordPress Engineered by OCTOPODAMI (WEBO), you can launch a WordPress stack pre-configured for auto-scaling, maintainability, performance, and security.

Our expert engineers developed this 1-Click Amazon Machine Images (AMI) with rapid deployment in mind; we guarantee you will be up and running in 60 seconds on Amazon Web Services.

Instead of spending countless hours learning the intricacies of configuring a scalable WordPress site, we've packaged our stack with everything you need to hit the ground running on the world's leading cloud platform.

## Features
